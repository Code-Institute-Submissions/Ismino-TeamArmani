## Credits
I've got stuck with the hero picture where i got help from student tutoring, they helped me understand how to put the picture but at the and I changed it all anyway. I also had an issue with the padding that my mentor helped me out with. The pictures are from my mother Petra Cigel and it's her dog. To the media section i googled how to make it and then i tested different things.

## Content
- The text for the pages where written by my mother who has a certificate in ocial service's dog's.
- The pictures was taken by my sister and sent to me from my mother.
- The icons was taken from font awsome. [font awsome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- For making my contact fill in i looked at basic form functions on w3cschool.
