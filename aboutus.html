      <h3>About us:</h3>
    <p> We all want to feel close, have social contact and laugh. But some don't get the opportunity to do that, but then we are there to be able to give all this to people who need it. As much joy as we can give, we get back by seeing people's joy and laughter at our meetings. We are there for both the elderly and the young, everyone who in some way needs a friend in their life. The dog is man's best friend!</p> 
    <p>My name is Petra Cigel and I am 47 years old. I have worked in childcare for 28 years and currently work as a special education teacher in Stockholm. Lonely people and people in need of support have always been close to my heart. Being there for others and being able to help and see their joy and progress makes me happy.</p> 
    <p> Armani is an American Bully, compact who is 1 year and 10 months old. He is very social, kind, obedient & loves to be with other people.
    <p> Working with Armani as a team that is there for other people became a matter of course for me when I heard about social service dogs. I, who have always wanted to be there for other people, and also got a new family member who turned out to be social, kind and loving felt that working as a social service dog team was created for us</p>
